Revenge Of The Day

KAUAI:	It’s official — Mother Nature wants Hawaii whacked..

KAUAI:	Amid all the chaos of Hawaii’s natural disasters this year, Pride of America’s best buffet is its healthy portions of calm, serenity and good times..

ADAM:	Yet, like some kind of kukui nut-necklaced “Iron Mike” Malloy, the islands cannot and will not be snuffed out. Tourism, however? The verdict has yet to be rendered. While main attractions are open and thirsty for visitors (Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, among them, while its host, the Big Island, is technically larger now thanks to the lava flow) there’s something about the words “volcanic eruption” that can leave potential visitors a mite skittish..

MOTHER:	If you’ve never met NCL’s 13-year-old, 2,186-passenger POA vessel, she’s really sort of a plain Jane — a girl-next-door type..

ADAM:	Superlative-free, meh-sexy Pride is neither the biggest this, nor the longest that. The pay-to-eat restaurants aren’t anything to call home about. To be honest, some of the best meals are had at the comped buffets (albeit, I graze like a cat) which are often themed (I ushered in Oktoberfest with scrumptious bratwursts and sauerkraut) and stay open late..

KAUAI:	Even the staffers, who work ridiculous zillion-hour days, seven days a week, for five months a year (then they get five months off, assuming their contract is renewed), can’t wipe the dang smiles off their faces. (Don’t try to buy your bartender a drink, though — they’re not allowed to have a BAC of over .04 at any given time. Something to do with maritime law, blech..

KAUAI:	This means Pride can bounce from one Hawaiian port to another (Honolulu to Kahului to Hilo to Kona, e.g.) without having to legally sail out into whack-a-doo international waters of, say, Fanning Island, which can take days, in between..

ADAM:	By far the most interesting person in all of Hawaii is the guide I had on my Polynesian Adventure Tour’s Kauai jaunt, which POA arranged..

KAUAI:	You’d have to spend a half million dollars on “Wheel of Fortune” just to buy the vowels in her first name: Kemapukakouenikealaokamaile..

MIKE:	But you can just call her Kana’e..

NATURE:	She drives a mercifully, generously air-conditioned bus around her native island, taking us to canyons and waterfalls and a coffee farm. But it’s her quirky rhetorical delivery that delights. She transitions between an infinity of topics with silly questions like, “Have you ever heard the word ‘Aloha’?” or “Do you know of the movie star Adam Sandler?” But she also gets extremely personal. My favorite: “Do you ask questions on dates? On Kauai, there are two you have to ask: Who’s your dad, and who’s your mom. It’s so small here, everyone is related. You could be dating your cousin!” And then 5 minutes later, she hilariously reveals she married her cousin (like 20 times removed, or some such). The only thing she dislikes about her rainy little island are the hordes of feral chickens everywhere that are too muscley to eat and she implores you bring them home as souvenirs (you can’t)..

MIKE:	Other in-port activities, depending on the island, include helicopter rides (a soothsaying Debbie Downer of an Irish bartender in NYC dissuaded me from that, but I digress), forest hikes, lavender and goat cheese farm tours..

TOURISM:	This is Hawaii — you can pretty much blindfold yourself and walk the plank off POA and enjoy yourself..

ADAM:	Or don’t. While that whole getting off the boat thing was fun, my favorite day of the week was a bit of a fluke. Hurricane Olivia thwarted our docking in Kona so we had an unplanned sailing day instead..

ADAM:	As someone who was a virgin to cruising, I was deathly afraid the heavily itinerated experience would amount to little more than recreational fascism (the cruise director’s voice being pumped directly into a speaker in my room didn’t help to assuage those fears). But all those cliches about cruising — the wind in your hair, taking salty air haymakers to the face, just sitting on a bar stool on deck 13, sipping something heavy on the ethanol and taking in the Polynesian view porn — really woke me to its magic..
